## 📄 Paper Abstract

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over time. We propose a comprehensive framework with two core components: **INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist)** and **IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment)**. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and 230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- **INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist)**: First computational framework translating narrative therapy principles into theory-driven, progression-aware therapy simulation
- **IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment)**: Novel therapy-centric evaluation method tracking narrative transformation markers ("Innovative Moments")
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive experiments with both automated assessment and human evaluation demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches

## 🔬 Framework Architecture

### Interactive Narrative Therapist (INT)
1. **Stage Planning**: Four progressive therapeutic stages
   - Trust Building (Reassuring)
   - Problem Externalization (Empowering) 
   - Re-authoring Conversation (Transformative)
   - Re-membering Conversation (Reconnecting)

2. **Reflection Level Planning**: Dynamic depth adjustment within each stage
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Expert-style response generation

### Innovative Moment Assessment (IMA)
- **Level 1 IMs**: Creating Distance from the Problem
- **Level 2 IMs**: Centered on the Change
- **Salience Metric**: Quantitative progression measurement
